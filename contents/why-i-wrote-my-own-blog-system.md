# Why I wrote my own blog system

There are several reasons I started this project.

* I missed writing node.js code. My day-to-day is almost exclusively python
  these days, and while I like the language, it's just not as *fun*.
* I wanted to start a dev blog, but using an already-existing solution sounded
  boring. Also building your dev blog yourself gives you content for the blog
  itself, so it seems like a good process.
* I wanted to play with some of the
  [Docker Hub](http://registry.hub.docker.com) features, namely webhooks.
